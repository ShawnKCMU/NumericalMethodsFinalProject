Numerically Calculating Coefficient of Drag and Rolling Resistance

Car models undergo extensive wind tunnel testing to analyze aerodynamic qualities like drag, lift, and thrust, enabling modifications for consumer needs. 
However, this testing is prohibitively expensive, prompting us to seek a more cost-effective method to determine rolling resistance and drag coefficients. 
Using Numerical Methods, including optimization, nonlinear differentiation, and numerical integration, we compared experimental and theoretical data to 
identify coefficients' accuracy. Our analysis involved comparing theoretical and experimental models for decelerating car velocity, 
determining constants for the best fit. These results inform the feasibility of our analysis as a substitute for expensive wind tunnel testing, 
addressing cost concerns and evaluating its worthiness as an alternative.
